Scrutly is a browser extension that analyzes downloaded files, generates SHA-256 and MD5 hashes, and displays JavaScript files loaded on a webpage. All processing—including hashing and identifying standard (.js) and unconventional (non-JS) JavaScript files—occurs locally for privacy. Additionally, Scrutly enhances web searching with advanced query capabilities (known as 'dorking'), empowering users to research JavaScript and downloaded files independently. It also requires no logins.
